Tweaks for "AI" devices. It is mostly not for you and is unnecessary on a prod. AI here does not mean Artificial/Apple Intelligence.

Requires [my Dopamine fork](https://github.com/khanhduytran0/Dopamine/tree/2.x-ai) to inject tweak into system processes.

## Fixing DeveloperDiskImage mount issues
"AI" devices has an unusual 00/01 value causing TSS to refuse signing. This tweak bypasses local checks to allow mounting DDI without personalized signature.

## 🚧 Fixing `com.apple.MobileAsset.SystemApp` server
Stock apps are provided via an internal server which is inaccessible outside of *the falling fruit*. This tweak will redirect the links to use public server instead.

## 🚧 Bypassing EU/Japan Marketplace checks
The old method of using [eligibility plist](https://github.com/Lrdsnow/EUEnabler) no longer works. This tweak will bypass the checks to allow accessing EU Marketplace apps on "AI" devices.
